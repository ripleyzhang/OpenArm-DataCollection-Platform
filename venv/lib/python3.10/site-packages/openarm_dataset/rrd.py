"""Convert OpenArm Dataset to rerun.io RRD file.

* Use `/` to separate entity path parts.
  * See also: https://rerun.io/docs/concepts/logging-and-ingestion/entity-path
* Use a blueprint to set up the visualization layout
  * See also: https://rerun.io/docs/howto/visualization/build-a-blueprint-programmatically
* Use `rr.send_columns()` to record the data in bulk.
  * See also: https://rerun.io/docs/howto/logging-and-ingestion/send-columns
* Record camera images as MP4 (requires `ffmpeg` on PATH). This will make the RRD file size smaller.
